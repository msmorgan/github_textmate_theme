# GitHub theme for TextMate

My version of a GitHub TextMate theme attempts to duplicate GitHub's syntax highlighting as accurately as possible. Modified from [Scott Becker's version][sbecker], which was [featured][feature] on GitHub's blog in 2008.

## Installing

As with all TextMate themes, just open the .tmTheme file to load it in TextMate!
